# Java CLI Generic RPG
### Originally created for the PA Media and Design Competition. Was unable to complete due to time constraints. May complete at a later time.
In its current state, this project has the following systems:
- Player creation
- NPC interaction and generation
- Location generation
- Inventory management (mostly)
- Enemy generation (A little)

Maybe I'll pick the project up at a later date, for now this is a showcase of my current proficency in Java and putting together everything I know.
